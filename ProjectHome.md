An open source SA-MP game mode, which tries to incorporate many game modes into one.

We appreciate help on this as it is open source, and it is not officially affiliated with the SA-MP team, nor is it currently endorsed by any SA-MP team members. This is solely a community project as of right now.

Here are some screen shots
